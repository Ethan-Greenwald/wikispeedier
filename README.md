# Wikispeedier: Speedier than Wikispeedia
A project by Ethan Greenwald, Nathaniel Dyer, Ayush Garg, and Nitya Sunkad.
UIUC CS 225.

## Overview
This project is based on the game Wikispeedia, an online game where players attempt to get from one Wikipedia article to another exclusively through clicking links. Our project is designed to determine the shortest path between any two articles. This utilizes the Wikispeedia navigation paths dataset provided by SNAP. 

## Algorithms
* **Dijkstra's Algorithm**
* **Breadth First Search**
* **Iterative Deepening Depth First Search (IDDFS)**
