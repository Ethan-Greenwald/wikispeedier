- Implement Dijkstra's
- Implement IDDFS
- Optimize BFS
  - Have data within function rather than with WikiNodes
  - Only need to track 1 parent rather than all linked_by 
  - Use map<WikiNode*, WikiNode*> for storing parents, map<WikiNode*, int> for storing depth, and map<WikiNode*, bool> for marking as visited
- Better RNG that doesn’t need sleep(1)?
- Implement WikiNode::getNameParsed()
  - Look for existing C++ function to decode HTML/UTF-8 encoding or just write one
- Take care of destructors for WikiNode, Graph, Algorithm
- Maybe move Algorithm to be part of Graph since it’s just a collection of functions to use on the graph?
